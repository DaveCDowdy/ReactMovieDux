MovieDux üçø
MovieDux is a dynamic single-page application (SPA) built with React. This project, a code-along from a Udemy course by Jannick Leismann, focuses on core React concepts and modern web development practices. It serves as a practical demonstration of building a UI for a movie watchlist application.

Features
Component-Based Architecture: The application is built with a modular, component-based design for better organization and reusability.

State Management with Hooks: It uses fundamental React Hooks, specifically useState and useEffect, to manage and update application state, including a dynamic watchlist.

Local Data Handling: The app fetches and displays movie data from a local movies.json file, demonstrating how to handle and render asynchronous data.

Routing: It uses React Router to manage navigation between different views.

Dynamic Watchlist: Users can add and remove movies from a watchlist, with changes reflected in real time.

Technologies Used
React: The primary library for building the user interface.

React Router: For declarative routing.

JavaScript (ES6+): The core programming language used throughout the project.

HTML5 & CSS3: For structuring and styling the application.
